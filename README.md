# Twitter_Sentiment_Classifier
Our goal is to predict tweet comment's sentiment by experimenting with two different types of vectorization (GloVe and TfIdf).


Our [dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dTIWNpjlrnTQBIQtaGOh0jCRYZiAQO79/view)

In [GloVe Model](https://github.com/spympr/Twitter_Sentiment_Classifier/blob/main/GloVe_Model.ipynb) we constructed functions which vectorize words with help of glove.6B.50d model, which we retrieved from [GloVe's site](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/). Afterwards, 

On the other hand, in [TfIdf Model](https://github.com/spympr/Twitter_Sentiment_Classifier/blob/main/TfIdf_Model.ipynb)
